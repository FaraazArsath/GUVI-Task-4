# GUVI-Task-4

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing student performance data from two CSV files (college_1.csv and college_2.csv). The provided tasks include categorizing students based on their CodeKata scores, calculating average performance, identifying top performers, and visualizing department-wise CodeKata performance.

## Tasks

### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries: The initial step involves importing the required libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation.

### 2. Categorizing Students: Each CSV file is split into multiple categories based on CodeKata scores.

Exceeded Expectations.csv: CodeKata score > 15000

Reached Expectations.csv: 10000 < CodeKata score < 15000

Needs Improvement.csv: 7000 < CodeKata score < 10000

Unsatisfactory.csv: CodeKata score < 7000

### 3. Comparing Previous and Current Performance: Calculates the average of previous week's Geekions versus current week's CodeKata scores.

### 4. Shining Stars of the Week: Identifies the top 3 candidates with the highest Geekions.

### 5. Department-wise CodeKata Performance (Pie Chart): Visualizes the distribution of CodeKata performance across different departments.
